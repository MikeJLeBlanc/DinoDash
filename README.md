# Premise
This game was created for the final 3 projects of mobile development course. This simple game allowed me to explore the Unity Engine to create the game.
I was also fortunate enough to access the Google Play store and the requirements needed to be able to upload a game or other application to the store.

## Gameplay Loop

The whole loop is to collect the eggs pictured above, while avoiding the Pterodactyls. The objective for the game is to collect as many eggs as you can.
While not inheritly exciting, this small game is part of the Quantum Arcade web application. With that, you'll be competing against other players for the top position on the leaderboards!
This allows this simple game to become part of a larger social ecosystem for high score glory!

Finally, if you get hit by the Pterodactyl, the game over screen appears with your score and you'll have the chance to try again! Go for glory!
